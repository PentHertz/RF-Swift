# RF Swift

Welcome to the RF Swift project! ðŸŽ‰ Our mission is to provide all the essential tools for both HAM radio enthusiasts and RF professionals. ðŸ“¡ðŸ”§

![RF Swift logo](images/logo.png "RF Swift logo")

Introducing our Go and shell script-based toolbox, designed to streamline the deployment of Docker containers for your preferred RF tools. This evolving toolkit promises even more features in the near future, making it an essential asset for RF enthusiasts.

Currently, the scripts are still under development. However, we invite you to contribute by adding any tools you find necessary for large-scale deployment.

Inspired by the remarkable [Exegol project](https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol), our toolbox aims to integrate all essential tools for radio analysis without requiring you to uninstall your preferred operating system. It also offers special Docker file recipes to help you conserve space based on your specific needs.

For those who prefer a single OS with all RF software, consider using [DragonOS](https://cemaxecuter.com/). But if your goal is to deploy tools within a container without affecting your host system, or saving space deploying specific recipes, this toolbox is your ideal solution.

Our philosophy is straightforward: maintain the integrity of your Linux or Windows systems while enjoying unrestricted RF experimentation. Start exploring RF without boundaries today!

## Requirements

### Linux

The tool requires only one direct dependency to install on you own:

- Docker engine (e.g: `apt install docker.io` in Ubuntu)

### Windows

You need to install 3 tools:

- Docker desktop following this link (making sure it is run in WSL 2): https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/#enabling-docker-support-in-wsl-2-distros
- GoLang installed with MSI package: https://go.dev/dl/
- `usbipd` as described here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb 

To attach USB device, you'll need first to detect the USB id you are connecting with this command line:

	usbipd wsl list

Then bind & attach this device:

	usbipd bind --busid <bus id>
	usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid>

After that, the device should appear on the container without issues ;)

## On Mac-OS - Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3

Even if the Go program can build in any platform and Dockerfile are compilable also on Mac OS, the USB may be difficult to reach on this platform.

For the moment, consider using the tool inside a VM that handles USB such as VM Fusion.

You can directly pull a working container from our registry using the `penthertz/rfswift:sdr_full_aarch64` reference: https://hub.docker.com/layers/penthertz/rfswift/sdr_full_aarch64/images/sha256-3385e49c1369bad2465e85c75b74ae241a0e285f0666321620c73fc9ff260996?context=repo

## Quick run

If you want to skip building the Go program you can pick one of the builded archive here: https://github.com/PentHertz/RF-Swift/releases/tag/v0.1-dev

Then if you want to use directly one of our builded container, please find tags you can pull from our official registry: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/penthertz/rfswift/tags

## Building

This section is about building your own images with our provided recipes, but also your own recipes as well.
If you want to use an already built docker container, you can skip this section and go the the "Pulling containers" one.

### On Linux

For the momemt the building script is rather simple and give you the choice of using a image tag name and a specific Docker file:

	./build.sh 
	[+] Installing Go
	...
	[+] Building RF Switch Go Project
	Enter image tag value (default: myrfswift:latest): 
	Enter value for Dockerfile to use (default: Dockerfile):

Note: uncomment some lines in Docker files, particularly if you are using the GPU with OpenCL

Note 2: the default tag that is used by the tool is `myrfswift:latest`. We will manage configuration file in the future to avoid precising it for each `run` and `exec` commands when using a non-default one.

### On Windows

Use the `build-windows.bat` instead after installing all the requirements.

## Pulling a container

If you want to use an already built container and save more time, you can pull one docker container from our official repository: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/penthertz/rfswift/tags

As an example, we'd like to pull `rfswift:bluetooth` that includes all tools from the `bluetooth.docker` file, we can use the following command:

	sudo ./rfswift pull -i "penthertz/rfswift:bluetooth" -t myrfswift:bluetooth
	[...]
	{"status":"Pulling from penthertz/rfswift","id":"bluetooth"}
	{"status":"Digest: sha256:44b12f2be4f596d4d788f70c401ee757f80b1c85a1f91b5d4c69cb1260d49b88"}
	{"status":"Status: Image is up to date for penthertz/rfswift:bluetooth"}


## Creating and running a container

To run a container, use the command `./rfswift run -h` to see needed arguments:

	[...]
	Usage:
	  rfswift run [flags]

	Flags:
	  -b, --bind string      extra bindings (separe them with commas)
	  -e, --command string   command to exec (by default: '/bin/bash')
	  -d, --display string   set X Display (by default: 'DISPLAY=:0')
	  -h, --help             help for run
	  -i, --image string     image (by default: 'myrfswift:latest')


By default, you can the command without arguments if you want to start the `/bin/bash` interpreter and use the default image tag name, and with default environment diplay variable.

### Not able to see some devices

You can add extra bindings with the following command line that helps bringing the PlutoSDR:

	sudo ./rfswift run -b "/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket,/dev/snd:/dev/snd,/dev/dri:/dev/dri"

## Executing a command inside an existing container

Running a command inside a previous container is fairly easy, if you run a cointainer and exit it.

All you need to do, is to execute the desire command as follows:

	sudo ./rfswift exec -e urh

if you want to run it into another existing container, you can precise the container ID as follows:

	sudo ./rfswift last # to get the list
	[...]
	[ 1716024976 ][ myrfswift:latest ] Container:  c9e223a987a36441fb631f4a11def746aabb1a1bc862b5f2589d5b3ac8429cb1 , Command:  /bin/bash
	[ 1716024209 ][ sha256:ed26c47b0d1dba0473a4729885374e04e24b4189125a245c77280fd472bf934b ] Container:  2354c99f6699b4f3abc97d55cdb825fcfafba2af1b27e02a612fc2586061eb6e , Command:  /bin/sh -c './entrypoint.sh eaphammer_soft_install'
	[ 1716021780 ][ myrfswift:rfid ] Container:  a3e91704571d92f9a48e355b1db0ca5a97769087aebf573a6295392fb3f4d394 , Command:  /bin/bash
	[ 1716021385 ][ sha256:95fd8938e078792fc3e09c1311c7bdbed3e8e112887b7f0f36bf5a57616cf414 ] Container:  0b922d0ee58c1235bdba13fe2793ee7544f16fc5a5a710df4ebc68b05b928cc8 , Command:  /bin/sh -c './entrypoint.sh mfoc_soft_install'
	[...]
	sudo ./rfswift exec -e /bin/bash -c c9e223a987a36441fb631f4a11def746aabb1a1bc862b5f2589d5b3ac8429cb1 # we are executing on the 'c9e223a987a36441fb631f4a11def746aabb1a1bc862b5f2589d5b3ac8429cb1' container

## Getting the latests containers

To get the 10 last containers you have create, you can use the following command:

	sudo ./rfswift last -h
	  rfswift last [flags]

	Flags:
	  -f, --filter string   filter by image name
	[...]
	sudo ./rfswift last -f myrfswift:latest # we are using a filter for images
	[ 1716024976 ][ myrfswift:latest ] Container:  c9e223a987a36441fb631f4a11def746aabb1a1bc862b5f2589d5b3ac8429cb1 , Command:  /bin/bash


## Commit changes

If you want to commit changes you've made of your container an start at this images later on a new one, you can use the `commit` command as follows:

	sudo ./rfswift commit -c <container id> -i myrfswift:newtag

## Renaming images

You can rename images using the `rename` command as follows:

	sudo ./rfswift rename -i myrfswift:supertag -t myrfswift:newsupertag

## Options

### OpenCL

You can enable OpenCL with the driver associated to your graphic card:

	# Installing OpenCL
	## NVidia drivers
	#RUN apt-fast install -y nvidia-opencl-dev nvidia-modprobe
	## Installing Intel's OpenCL
	#RUN apt-fast install -y intel-opencl-icd ocl-icd-dev ocl-icd-opencl-dev
 
![OpenCL recipe in action](https://github.com/PentHertz/RF-Swift/assets/715195/a29eedd5-b1df-40fc-97c0-4dc5323f36a8)

 ### RTL-SDR

 The RTL-SDR v4 uses a different driver that replaces the others.

Until we find a proper way to support both drivers, comment the basic function and uncomment the v4 one in the recipe as follow:

	#RUN ./entrypoint.sh rtlsdr_devices_install
	RUN ./entrypoint.sh rtlsdrv4_devices_install # optionnal, remove rtlsdr_devices_install if you are using the v4 version

	# Installing gr-fosphor with OpenCL
	#RUN ./entrypoint.sh grfosphor_grmod_install

## How to contribute

You are warmly welcomed to contribute to fill scripts we your desired tools.

In the future, we will create a dedicated page for developpers.

## Troubleshooting

### Sound

The sound is sometimes not restarting when stoping to play with tools like SDR++. 

To solve it for the moment, you can restart the tool and try playing it.

Some tools like GQRX are not yet working with the sound, we will try to fix it when possible, but you can also capture the signal and demodulate it to `wav` and play it with Audacity as a quick fix.

If some contributor have the time to solve this issue, that would be awesome <3

### Wiki??!

We will find out some time to build one ;)
